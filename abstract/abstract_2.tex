\section*{Abstract}

The present work focuses on the development of an information extraction system for documents of any type and format,
using advanced technologies and modern software architecture approaches.

Since this general objective may be too ambitious for a final year project, the specific objective will be to create a
tool capable of processing \textit{PDF} documents, focusing on two specific types of documents: residential lease
agreements between individuals and vehicle sale contracts between individuals.

By applying the principles of \textit{clean code} and \textit{clean architecture}, the quality of the code and the
ability to add support for new document formats and new types of contracts can be ensured.

For the development of the system, a modular approach was used, implementing two main components: the
\textit{Generator}, which converts PDF documents into text, and the \textit{Reader}, which extracts the required
information from the generated text.

The analysis of the results demonstrated 100\% accuracy in the identification and extraction of data for the test
sets used.
However, since LLM models like \textit{ChatGPT}are not deterministic systems and the sample is relatively small, the
actual results may be slightly lower.

In terms of performance, it was found that the core of the system is fast, although the overall performance depends on
the tools selected for the infrastructure layer.
Performance tests showed low execution times for local tools like \textit{PDF To Text}, but higher times for the
\textit{ChatGPT} \textit{API}.
